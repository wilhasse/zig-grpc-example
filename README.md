# zig-grpc-example

Noob attempt at getting up and running with gRPC and Zig.

## Running

- Zig code requires latest `zig` built from source against `master` or installed via homebrew with `brew install zig --HEAD`.
- If errors occur, get latest Xcode on macOS.  
- gRPC and proto code is built with Bazel.
